## Overview ###########################################################

The PAGE token is a token with books at heart. PAGE represents a network of human beings who support the idea that creating things should provide a viable income, no matter where a creator is from or what that creator’s role in the greater ecosystem of the creative life of human beings happens to be. As such, PAGE is designed to be a decentralized network with the intention of including more people in this creative way of life, rather than an exclusive and/or centralized network built around the intention of keeping a majority of people out to increase the profits of a few industry mainstays.

The PAGE token launch begins a long process of development which will ultimately result in a Cosmos SDK blockchain capable of administering governance to the network via DAO, facilitating transactions across a far-reaching network, and keeping said network online by collecting fees in the native PAGE token. PAGE supply will be capped at 100M, with 10M minted to the Ethereum blockchain and 90M to be minted to Cosmos at a later date. The way forward for the PAGE network seems clear: disrupt the traditional book and ebook industries by providing a more streamlined publishing platform. 

PAGE will offer more transparency into the performance of books while lowering costs to authors and publishers to a minimum. Instead of separate licenses for each form a given book might take, one NFTBook can be updated and will be able to serve video and audio content in addition to the traditional text files offered by popular e-reader apps and devices today, but in addition to this, NFTBooks will also offer the capacity to request a print copy at printer cost via the dAPP contained in each and every book. 

NFTBooks are unstoppable, consisting of a blockchain-saved reference point and an IPFS back end that is as strong as the network it resides upon. With public + private key encryption to lock the content behind a permissioned token gate and prevent unauthorized access, NFTBooks will even begin to surpass the security of paper book and ebook formats. With digital ownership and scarcity, markets for NFTBooks will be more efficient than anything that has come before. Even the Gutenberg Press and its various antecedents could not create books as durable and censorship-resistant as NFTBooks. 

Welcome to a revolution in literary technology.

## The Vision for PAGE Network ###########################################################

### Introduction
There is an uncountable number of authors and ideas that will not be allowed to move forward with their dreams, their work, or their obsessions. Financial considerations dictate that these people focus their time and energy on something else. This oversight, that many people would love to create but cannot afford to, is a simple fact of the inefficient present-day publishing system; a publishing market designed around barriers to entry for unknown individuals and characterized by go-to-market difficulties faced by book publishers as a whole. There is an access problem on the other side of the coin as well: many nations today suffer limited access to the funds needed to secure the latest books, and aside from local economies, the means needed to raise funds for studies are non-existent, which hampers education even among people who desire it. And we mean to end that by creating a blockchain for books capable of storing, pricing, sorting, distributing and settling transactions. As the market becomes more efficient, books will become more universally accessible.

Blockchain technology can make the world’s literature available to the world’s people at an entirely new level by minimizing waste and making use of finance-oriented protocols to create and fund new literary explorations. What if reading books for free wasn’t enough? If you’d like to be paid to read, there are possibilities for you here. A small number of tokens should allow you to buy and sell books on the blockchain for a fraction of the cost you’d pay to read so many titles on competing platforms selling eBooks, or perhaps you’d prefer to lend your titles to friends or deposit them into a vault.

Decentralized distribution allows all market entrants equal access to the technology and financial tooling needed to create excellent new properties… for books. Enabling NFT technologies will allow an entirely new set of properties to be integrated into the book market for the first time in history. 

It is possible to create a fully decentralized blockchain-based library of NFTBooks that pay their authors and promoters more to make and distribute books than traditional markets have previously paid such people. By bringing financial tools from DeFi to the publishing industry, it is possible to allow the purchasers and readers of books on the blockchain to financially benefit from their involvement in this reshaped and renewed publishing industry. To do this, it is first necessary to create a blockchain capable of efficiently and automatically creating and distributing NFTBooks. 

In this case, that blockchain consists of a standard, 3-part, publicly owned Cosmos SDK blockchain involving a network, a token, and a virtual machine. At the time of writing, this blockchain does not exist. The PAGEDAO will take effect at such time that this blockchain is ready to go live, allowing control of the network and buildout of features by the PAGEDAO community, in addition to principal developer WIP Publishing. 

The virtual machine will be a standard EVM-capable Cosmos SDK Ethermint state machine, the token will be the new WIPP-proprietary PAGE token, and the network will be created in a decentralized manner very similar to the $OSMO network’s creation--a fairdrop to NFTBook-holders and community members. In this way, an efficient and extraordinarily decentralized app-specific blockchain for NFTBook trading can be created almost overnight, with benefits accruing to three specific initiatives: development, liquidity, and volume.

The lessons learned from the $OSMO quadratic fairdrop are applicable to all new chain launches moving forward. $PAGE will be a powerful early use case for ICAs, or initial coin airdrops. This launch strategy will entail substantially less risk than ICOs and comparable fundraising methods due to the lack of offering at a structured price. There is risk in trusting the community to adequately price the token of the project, but projects which are approved of and supported by the community will face few barriers to entry for the immediate future. Economics has fundamentally changed; governance and trust have been modified as well.

### What is an NFTBook?
The NFTBook Standard is under development by the WIP (Work in Progress) Publishing Company. Currently, the development has reached Alpha status after a warm reception of the Genesis NFTBook series. NFTBook Alpha supports beautiful visuals and can be viewed in the WIP Publishing collections on OpenSea. Each NFTBook is a digital certificate of ownership which tracks and values the content of the work and has the property of digital scarcity, which enables the set of innovations to be outlined in this document.

### Background
The WIP Publishing Company was originally founded as a spinoff of Libernet DAO, an organization dedicated to bringing the world’s books to the world’s people for the first time. Democratizing access to literature has remained a priority for the WIPP team, though the structure became a C-Corporation geared toward raising venture capital to bring a series of books to market when we broke away from Libernet. 

Why couldn’t the art market’s success in NFT Art be used as a model for a market designed to distribute books? Even a profit-incentivized corporation could be used to create a network and application suite geared toward the production of books as NFTs. Each of the benefits enjoyed by artists could become a selling point for such a network:

NFTs eliminate the middleman. Artists don’t have to wait around and pay lump sums to gallery owners or show organizers anymore. NFT distribution allows artists to network directly with collectors, saving time and money.
Digital permanent ownership is desirable. Artists are able to trust in the blockchain record of the transaction to remain immutable. NFT immutability allows artists to achieve maximum credit for their work, even online.
Royalties, in perpetuity over the life of a widely traded NFT asset, will be substantial. Even resellable print books only pay their dealers. NFTBooks can be tagged with royalties that never fail to pay the author on time.
Novel content is possible here. A book can now have 20+ authors and trustlessly pay each of them, on time every time. It can contain audio, or print book creation functionality. Who knows what people will eventually use NFTBooks to store? Everything from physical objects to virtual worlds is possible.


A variety of issues stood in the way of widespread NFTBooks: royalties, unstable prices, book layout, book security. Each of these hurdles has been addressed by a small team of innovative and dedicated NFT pioneers. We are pleased to announce that we believe we have found a technological system worthy of the loftiest pursuit in the history of literature: uploading all of the world’s books to the blockchain.

The WIPP company minted the first PAGE ERC-20 token in July of 2021. A few months of hard work and dedicated market research had revealed a need in the market: eBooks are a deficient content delivery system because they rely upon centralized (read: censorable) servers under the control of singular, for-profit institutions. Even without malice on the part of these organizations, GeoCities teaches a lesson to internet users everywhere: your content has a finite shelf life. The web does not record its history effectively.

This key market lesson uncovered the core of the value proposition of the NFTBook: an immutable decentralized storage system capable of storing, remembering, and making available all of the world’s content; with unexpected benefits including royalties payable to authors attachable to on-platform secondary sales, decentralized DRM options, and scalability far exceeding any other solution technology has yet made possible. The vibrant open source community in and around the blockchain space has made these technologies available to savvy entrepreneurs at little or no cost, with minimal coding and/or development required to spin up functional solutions.

This perfect storm of benefits has led to the term Web3.0 being used to describe blockchain development environments and the products created by the labors of these talented teams of developers. Open source software is entering a Renaissance, and the overhead associated with application development is nearing an all-time low. As people everywhere begin to become familiar with the tech stack that will make up the internet of the future, the most logical question to ask is how history will rhyme with itself here: how will people mold the backbone of knowledge, the book, to suit this new online environment?

 
### Rapid Development Opportunity

PAGE provides an opportunity to use market incentives and inflation to rapidly deploy a universal currency around books. Ultimately, it would be ideal to create automated market makers (AMMs) around NFTBooks to maximize the liquidity of the assets themselves, thus transforming books into value-backed currency, which of course will also include all utility points: text, audio, image, video, interactive, and other content forms can all be worked into the NFTBook Standards. The result of this vision is a book market like the world has never seen before--eBooks are non-transferable and there are no secondary markets, and paper books can never be thought of as immutable. 

What if there was an NFTBook that contained the option to have a high quality print of the text drop-shipped from a Print-on-Demand center near you, wherever you are in the world?

PAGE can create this technology by applying DeFi and the principles of decentralized governance to raise funds, hire additional developers and marketers to build a robust team to create and maintain rapidly scaling architecture capable of challenging the established players in the publishing industry with help from Tendermint and the Cosmos ecosystem. 

## PAGE Token Financial Strategy ###########################################################


The PAGE token is a revolutionary innovation which will allow a team of dedicated misfits to compete with pedigreed startups and, indeed, the major players in the publishing industry, without even needing to sell the concept to venture capitalists or angel investors as a starting point. This is possible because of the efforts of teams such as the Cosmos SDK project Regen Network, which have shown that alternatives exist in the fundraising space now that decentralized finance (DeFi) has reached global acceptance and the open source tools that make it possible have begun to proliferate financial markets. 

As a direct result of these developments in blockchain and financial technologies, it is now possible to work long and hard enough to achieve financial goals without doing anything all that remarkable. The WIP Publishing Company has only sold about thirty NFTBooks to date, with gross sales totaling under $600, but the generosity and patience of WIPP authors combined with the power of the blockchain community into which WIPP was born to produce an environment in which a token launch could pave the road to funding, marketing, and technological needs being met without an ICO or a single meeting with a traditional venture capital firm. 

The NFTBook Bazaar
The token will be launched alongside the NFTBook Bazaar Beta release with little of the excessive fanfare one would expect from such an ambitious project, but we here at WIPP believe that this token represents an opportunity to compete on a global level on behalf of authors and readers everywhere to make publishing more rewarding and make books more available. 

The NFTBook Bazaar will attach a 2% fee to all transactions (buy, sell, trade, etc) that take place on the site, but otherwise there will be no need for fees or other financial arrangements between WIPP or PAGEDAO and the users of the platform and blockchain network under construction. 





### Summary of PAGE Token Distribution


The PAGE token will be distributed in four buckets, with the bulk of the distribution centered upon mining strategies designed to grow the network in a way that empowers the most able and willing community participants without disenfranchising anyone at launch. These buckets are as follows:

Decentralized Network Growth: 50%
PAGE Network Development: 30%
Community Support Incentives: 15%
Founding Team Rewards: 5%

![Summary of PAGE Token Distribution](https://github.com/wippublishing/page-dao/blob/main/resources/summary-of-page-token-dist.png)





We believe that this distribution rewards the founding team that created the token adequately to incentivize further contributions to the project while simultaneously financing the development of the PAGE network as a decentralized public blockchain. The key elements of this strategy are to maximize decentralization on the basis of game theory; i.e., the distribution system is a game which has been designed to reward participants who support the network by developing technology, providing liquidity, transacting on the network during its early days, and working with other community members toward shared goals rather than competing with others in a perceived zero-sum game. 

What has fundamentally changed about books, here, is that the transactional value of an asset is now a permanent aspect of an immutable decentralized network. The network does not yet have its own chain, but is envisioned as a fully scalable, application-specific Cosmos SDK Blockchain. By beginning with Ethereum, PAGE can start out where the most liquidity is and then pull transaction volume from Ethereum to its own native chain when sufficient development has been achieved on both the technology and marketing fronts. Hence, purchasing an NFTBook involves purchasing a part of the book-oriented network being created which can of course be sold later to any willing participant on the secondary market to recoup at least part of the purchase price, but the network will remember the author and can compensate royalties on secondary transactions as a result. 

Rather than duplicating locked-down files whose purchase serves only to line the pockets of Amazon investors, the internet book of Web3.0 will always benefit the author when transactions are executed. These assets are also, of course, immutable and capable of being delivered in print, electronic, audio, video, video game, or even full-length feature film forms—so the difference between an eBook (limited text delivery capabilities, one-time transactional capability, and centralized server dependence) and an NFTBook will immediately become clear as market support for NFTBooks develops.



## Detailed PAGE Token Breakdown ###########################################################

![Token Release Schedule graphic](https://github.com/wippublishing/page-dao/blob/main/resources/token-release-schedule.png)



PAGE Token Distribution Strategy

![Token Distribution](https://github.com/wippublishing/page-dao/blob/main/resources/page-token-dist.png)


PAGE tokens will be distributed to ETH users via a network including TrustSwap locks and vesting contracts as well as three Gnosis Safe Multisig Wallets set up to automatically distribute tokens to partner destinations in the community, among PAGEDAO Founders, and in return for services WIPP will initially provide such as developing technology and marketing. 

Particular beneficiaries of the PAGE development strategy will include 3 classes of miners: developers, liquidity miners, and volume miners. Volume and Liquidity mining will receive 50% of the token issuance over the first 1.5 years on the Ethereum network, this activity will continue until the assets are distributed or governance vote modifies this plan in some way. It is possible that a Cosmos launch will necessitate a restructuring of these incentives to reflect increased development timeframe and token supply modifications to reach an ever-increasing user base. 

### Decentralized Network Creation Via LP & Volume Incentives: 50%

![Funding and Mining graphic](https://github.com/wippublishing/page-dao/blob/main/resources/funding-mining.png)



Decentralized Network Growth is a priority because it can protect WIPP’s team from any sort of legal liability associated with accusations of malfeasance, market manipulation, or token price control. It is important to make it impossible for the WIPP team to comprise a majority of the tokens which are intended to one day operate the PAGE DAO as a decentralized and democratic institution. 

Projects such as LBRY and Publica have failed to adhere to the standards of decentralization and have paid the price of bringing Web2.0 ownership and control models into the Web3.0 space. 

Not so with $PAGE, which will begin its life in the hands of a small startup with transparent intentions and, through community involvement, bloom into a powerful DAO based upon a Cosmos SDK network. 

It is the explicit intention of WIP Publishing, Inc. to make the technologies available to the public as rapidly as they can be developed and to create a Cosmos-based token controlled governance structure which, when it reaches mainnet development, can structure everything needed for full DAO autonomy from the WIP Publishing Company and all other single entities, to be run in a fully decentralized manner and in accord with all laws and regulations which apply to such entities.

As such, the specific token distribution at this time is intended to include the following:

30% of token supply will be distributed over a 1.5-year period as Liquidity Mining Incentives to be divided equally between Liquidity Providers at Uniswap initially and later perhaps via a Cosmos-based alternative such as Osmosis.
20% of token supply will be distributed over the same 1.5-year period as Volume Mining Incentives to encourage user engagement on the NFTBook Bazaar platform.


The NFTBook Bazaar will be the initial outlet for all things on the PAGE network but will by no means ever even attempt to secure exclusivity for itself in this field. Other suitable platforms may be developed, and these incentives may be adapted and modified, with the primary goal remaining the benefit and protection of the authors and readers these platforms serve. 

Participation in these incentives will be open to all members of the public who care to learn how to do so safely, and to make it impossible for WIPP team members to monopolize the accumulation of these rewards, Founding Team and Development incentives will be paid out monthly over a vesting period of 1.5 years. 

As a result, though the founding team will begin with a claim to 5% of the total supply of the token, WIP Publishing is limited to less than 50% of token distribution and will be forced by market and business conditions to distribute most of what it receives each month. This limited Founding Team reward structure and independence from WIPP for the token ensures that WIPP’s interests do not ever have the ability to monopolize, manipulate, or control the public network we intend to create.


### PAGE Network Development: 30%

![Development and Strategic Reserve](https://github.com/wippublishing/page-dao/blob/main/resources/development-strategic-reserve.png)

30% of the token will be distributed to PAGE Network participants in return for specific development milestones.  The initial plan will release the 30% development budget for the initial token issuance to the WIPP Company over the next 1.5 years; WIPP will be empowered to delegate this benefit to other contractors or hire subcontractors including via the exchange of PAGE through the Liquidity Pool infrastructure for ETH or another token to then exchange for USD or other fiat currency to compensate them for their services.

As a condition of this mutually beneficial arrangement, WIPP will do nothing to stop anyone else from using the PAGE network to build platforms to distribute NFTBooks on or off the PAGE network. This arrangement will incentivize the priority of the network and promote the continual development of ever-improving technological standards for the creation, transmission, and means for settlement of NFTBooks, which is the WIPP Company’s mission. WIPP recognizes that the public blockchain, if launch is successful, will form a DAO for the continuing creation and development of the PAGE network, the PAGE DAO.

The proposed initial allocation strategy of these tokens involves the primary goal of developing $PAGE, which will be primarily handled at least at first by the WIP Publishing Company on behalf of the PAGE DAO until such time as on-chain governance makes control via Cosmos possible. This allocation strategy can be changed at any time, but must always remain public knowledge. 

In addition to new incentives being added to these pools from time to time, including investments from other DAOs or decentralization-oriented corporations or by issuance of more PAGE tokens, incentives can be tuned to deliverables (i.e., if a budgeted Staff position is unfilled, those tokens will be held in a strategic reserve pool along with any tokens collected by WIPP as fees or sales proceeds for distribution later). 


### Community Support Incentives: 15%

The community of DAOs and decentralization-oriented corporations which will receive the 15% of total token supply allocated for the first 1.5 years will be allowed to vary over time. 3% will be issued in five Community Support Initiatives over the first sixteen months of operation, beginning in August 2021 and ending in December 2022. 

The recipients of these grants can receive benefits upon completion of any requirements agreed upon by PAGE network at the time of the grant. At launch, NFTs representing varying amounts of $PAGE may be airdropped to organization grant recipients; afterward recipients will be able to dispose of the $PAGE in any means they see fit unless otherwise agreed upon prior to airdrop receipt. 


### Founding Team Rewards: 5%

5% is a sufficient pool of $PAGE to compensate the Founding Team for their time, love, and effort in bringing this project to life. The decentralization needs of the network we wish to create supersede our own in this case. 

This $PAGE grant will vest over a period of 1.5 years, unconditionally, to approved wallets owned by the correct recipients. Once disbursed, granted $PAGE tokens can be spent, staked, LP’ed, traded, or otherwise disposed of in any way seen fit by the Founding Team Member endowed with the tokens. Unclaimed Founding Team token distributions will be held in the multisig and released on schedule when the relevant Team Member is located. Advisors will be compensated from this pool as well.

## PAGE Marketing Strategy ###########################################################


### Background


NFTs have really taken off over the past year or so. Ending 2020 with a total market capitalization of $385M, in April of 2021 the NFT Market had already exceeded $22B in total size, meaning it is on track to more than 10x in size during 2021. Our hypothesis at WIPP in founding the PAGE network is that there is room for new asset classes to move into the NFT space to take advantage of the unique properties of non-fungible tokens and the blockchains they reside upon to simplify and decentralize the market for books. 

PAGE is a revolutionary new blockchain network designed to make it easier than ever before to buy, sell, read, transfer, lend, and borrow books using Web3.0 technology. To market PAGE, it will be important to consider the blockchain aptitude of given market niches to accept and begin utilizing blockchain technology to solve the problems facing book users in today’s market. 

More specifically, it will be necessary to find ways to cater to buyers, investors, and collectors who already know what an NFT is and are at least familiar enough with blockchain technology to purchase an NFTBook using cryptocurrency. As a result, there will be two main types of campaigns: education and awareness, until such time as an easy-to-use UI is developed. This strategy is intended to enable PAGE network to develop to reach the widest audience possible by starting small, with a dedicated client base in today’s cryptocurrency and NFT enthusiasts.

### Education

Non-native crypto users who discover the PAGE network and want to participate in its growth by buying NFTBooks, self-publishing NFTBooks, publishing NFTBooks on behalf of writers, or adding NFTBook editions of out-of-copyright content to it are encouraged to do so and educated via video and written content about how to do so. Rewards for this education are provided in $PAGE tokens which will be set aside for this purpose at launch. The program can be re-evaluated as time goes by to determine appropriate reward thresholds to obtain maximum engagement for the minimum amount of investment.

PAGE Network Education will be similar in character to the approach taken by Coinbase Earn. Videos could be watched in return for a reward paid in $PAGE tokens which users could then use to purchase NFTBooks. 

### Awareness

Tweets, Medium articles, YouTube videos, and other content centered around what NFTBooks are and how they work, in addition to hype campaigns for specific NFTBooks published by WIPP or other NFTBook publishers will serve to boost awareness of the NFTBook project among people who already understand the core concepts needed to engage with the current community in a meaningful way. 

Awareness campaigns will serve to boost the public’s engagement with the WIPP community to facilitate the growth of NFTBook creation, sales, and other transactions. The PAGE token should stand to benefit as well, and community-driven engagement campaigns will be welcomed with open arms by the WIPP core development team. 


### Events

Events will take place via video/voice either synchronously or asynchronously in Discord and in real life, including in-person events as well as Twitter Spaces events, Clubhouse events, Live broadcasts to YouTube, and author-requested events to suit the needs of a given textual artifact/audience.

Events will include community-led book clubs, author-led book signings, a weekly TokenSmart show via Discord, and regular shows on the WIPP discord channel for WIPP-backed authors. 


## DAO Drop Plan ###########################################################




### Introduction (Ethereum, 10M PAGE)


WIP Publishing is launching the PAGE token to create a decentralized blockchain network for books. DRM, buying and selling, borrowing and lending, liquidity as a property of semi-fungible NFT asset classes, and the rapid assimilation of off-chain literature are all goals which can be facilitated rapidly via decentralized network and governance. Ethereum is where the network will begin as a platform; a Cosmos SDK chain is the end goal for two reasons: effective on-chain governance and an application-specific blockchain with high throughput and low costs to operate.

### The Plan
DAOs and decentralization-oriented companies (communities) in the cryptocurrency/NFT space will be the recipients of grants of $PAGE equal to 15% of the total supply of PAGE tokens over the first sixteen months of network activity. The benefits for the PAGE network are clear: decentralization and marketing, as well as primary functions for transferring, buying, and selling NFTBooks are the primary pain points that this strategy addresses. Substantial value may accrue to recipients who sell, hold, or LP (provide liquidity for) their PAGE tokens against first ETH and later Cosmos, Osmosis and other chains on a variety of DEXes. 

### Ideal Grant Recipients


A good fit between the PAGE network and a DAO grant recipient will involve:

A plan to distribute the tokens to community members and/or hold them in a community treasury;
Possible collaborations between the WIPP team and grant recipient communities;
Participation on the part of $PAGE recipients in the development and governance of the PAGE network;
Possible participation by recipient organizations in $PAGE LPs to earn $PAGE liquidity mining incentives. (total incentives: 30% of total $PAGE supply during initial phase) 

### Estimated Grant Details


Total token allocation: 15% of max ETH supply, over 1.5 years, distributed to successful prior grant recipients and/or new recipients as decided by the WIPP team until the PAGE DAO becomes operational and takes control of these decisions (subject to change upon Cosmos IBC token launch);
10 community recipients per allocation period, stratified according to perceived level of alignment between PAGE DAO’s interests and those of recipient communities;
Varying allocations in the range of .1% to 1% of token supply to be granted immediately to participants with no strings attached;
Additional or unclaimed $PAGE may be allocated to individual recipients.



## PAGE DAO Drop ########################################################### 


**Phase 1**
Identify as many sympathetically aligned organizations as possible, meet them, and present the concept.

**Phase 2**
Present this document to said communities to provide full transparency and clarity.

**Phase 3**
Determine which organizations are most fully aligned with long-term goals for the PAGE network.

**Phase 4**
Organizations receive $PAGE grants to dispose of (use) as they please and/or as otherwise agreed upon. 

Options include holding the token, staking, farming, or adding liquidity into an LP for the token in return for liquidity mining rewards to be paid in $PAGE as well as a portion of the pool’s swap fees, or selling for ETH via the PAGE/ETH pool on Uniswap to fund operations or projects.

## Long-Term Vision ###########################################################

Liquidity Pools (LPs) provide the first-ever automated market making solution that can be applied to virtually any industry. Books are a natural place to start for the same reasons that Bezos and Amazon started with them back in the 1990s during Web1.0. By creating this infrastructure for books in the Web3.0 age, we will open the door to a future in which all virtual and physical goods and services can be traded, tracked, and accounted for via application-specific blockchain.

### What is a Liquidity Pool (LP)?

A liquidity pool involves assets on blockchain networks being paired against each other to determine the price of exchange between the tokens and distribute them automatically according to the needs of the market. Recently, Osmosis launched on the Cosmos Network via airdrop + inflationary tokenomics. The launch has been a tremendous success, resulting in an early market capitalization of over $300M and an implied diluted valuation in excess of $1B. Users of the DEX are able to exchange $ATOM (which can easily be purchased on any centralized exchange) for any other asset on Osmosis. Having procured a second token by exchanging $ATOM for it, users are able to LP a combination of $ATOM and the second token if they so choose. Thus far, $OSMO pools seem to be doing very well and $OSMO is the primary reward being paid to DEX users, $OSMO stakers, and Osmosis LPers, though PAGE could be added to LP incentives to Osmosis pools in which PAGE is a featured pool token. 

### More Efficiency = More Profit for Creators

To pair this launching/scaling methodology with a blockchain consisting of something as real as NFTBooks people can truly own is perhaps the most lucrative possible investment in the world today. Real-world assets will demonstrate an ability to onboard new participants in excess of any present-day competing solution, and the rapid growth possible here overshadows other potential blockchain use-cases so long as sufficient connectivity to the external liquidity from banking networks and other blockchains such as Ethereum is made available by Osmosis and GravityDEX and the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol.

### Integration of Blockchain With Real World Assets

Existing Public Libraries will be incentivized to participate in the launch of the PAGE ecosystem via financial incentives made possible by DeFi interactions with physical/tangible goods markets. Inflationary incentives tied to real-world assets can be used to restructure asset economies using incentives (see: Regen Network, Pylons, NFT Art movement). Integration with real-world assets such as books and intellectual property will have a tendency to distribute rewards across the network, regardless of geographical boundaries. 

Cryptocurrency incentives will increase interest within the narrow community of those who are able and willing to create and/or curate books for an audience by incentivizing authorship and the uploading of works in the public domain to the blockchain via financial reward payable in PAGE tokens. Scaling the network to contain the 135,000,000+ distinct books that exist today will involve creating an algorithm capable of identifying each distinct book with or without human assistance as well as identifying and implementing incentives and rewards necessary to acquire all of the books.


### LPs as Bookstores and Libraries

Users will be able to create new libraries by assembling collections of NFTBooks and putting up PAGE tokens as collateral into liquidity pools which function as Automated Market Makers for Books--the robot booksellers of the future. Each LP will feature a DAO empowered to set the Target Price for its books. Books can be minted to increase supply, automatically, to maintain the price of the work.

Liquidity can be provided by WIPP or other publishers, community members, collectors, authors, writers, and artists. No one who possesses the correct assets will be turned away by the algorithms, though content which is plagiarized and/or otherwise problematic will be dealt with according to the policy set by the DAO in charge of the collection in which that work has been minted.


## NFTBook Liquidity Pool Structure ###########################################################

![NFTBook vs Kindle](https://github.com/wippublishing/page-dao/blob/main/resources/NFTBookBazaarFlow.jpeg)

NFTBook Liquidity pools will be used to issue NFTBooks into the marketplace at a Target Price (TP) set by vote by quorum of LP DAO members (Each is ultimately a blockchain-based publishing house that issues NFTs instead or in addition to printed physical books). The liquidity pools will feature a PAGE token with which any given NFTBook can be paired. The TP is enforced by the minting of additional assets as required by the market to keep the price of any individual asset beneath a given threshold, thus automatically pairing increased supply to increased demand for an asset or by depositing excess PAGE tokens from the LP into the wallets of LP Token holders on the basis of the % of the LPT held by each individual. Undesired price decreases can be mitigated by similarly burning assets or depositing additional PAGE tokens into the pool. 


### How NFTBook LPs Start

To create a liquidity pool, a ratio of PAGE tokens to NFTBooks (target price) must be defined (it can later be changed by the LP DAO). A number of PAGE tokens and NFTBook tokens equivalent to this ratio must be deposited into the pool. The depositing address will receive in return LP Tokens (LPTs) which will qualify the holder to call votes regarding proposals of particular sorts of actions (deposit and/or withdraw PAGE from all LPT-holding wallets, change TP, etc) and vote or delegate voting privileges to another address. 

### Benefits of PAGE Token Usage

PAGE tokens will enable users to purchase NFTBooks at a discounted price vs other accepted cryptocurrencies (interoperability facilitated by Starname and IBC technology) and will provide a means by which to compensate Validators on the PAGE network to keep the PAGE state machine online. 

## NFTBook Price Discovery ###########################################################

If NFTBook price = (NFTBooks in the pool / TVL in PAGE in the pool), NFTBooks can be automatically issued to stabilize the price around a target set by the governance DAO in by vote facilitated by $ATOM SDK boilerplate as long as the supply for the book does not exceed demand by a degree sufficient to price out consumers from the market. 

### Primary Market LPs and Automated Minting to Maintain Target Price 

The target price (TP) of the work is set after Price Discovery and incentives to LP are similar in scale to $OSMO’s setup (native token distribution to incentivise LPing and Staking behaviors). TP is adjusted by a pool-specific DAO, and instead of borrowing or lending at launch, readers will simply purchase the book, granting access to text and/or audio functionality via the dAPP/NFTBook tokens created via the dAPP at nftbookbazaar.com. Borrowing the NFTBook can thus pay a user if the price of the book expands substantially between acquisition and return of the NFTBook, but the NFTBook price can crash if supply exceeds demand, so staking and HODLing options must be balanced with respect to the rewards generated by users.

Eventually, multi-book NFTBook Pools can form (once network conditions create sufficient volume to populate them) and set NFTBook prices relative to one another, but that probably requires either an upgrade to this basic concept or an additional module to enable it to value the various assets against one another. Lending and/or temporarily cloning assets from a pool can be enforced via smart contracts, but again this functionality will become available sometime after the initial launch.

### Secondary NFTBook Market LPs

In addition to the primary, publisher-run NFTBook stores, secondary markets won't create new NFTBooks, but could profit by re-selling existing ones or undercutting prices that are set too high in the primary LPs that have the ability to mint more NFTBooks. This competition allows the market to reach a stable equilibrium and the incentives to align between writers, readers, and publishers to automatically price and distribute NFTBooks according to precise measurements of market demand. Furthermore, this technology stack could handle blogs or tweets just as easily as books, audiobooks, and translations of the same book into different languages. The PAGE chain could accurately be labelled a new Osmosis variant that handles NFTs instead of crypto tokens from other blockchains. Ownership of a particular book could track with ownership of the minting or primary LP for that book.
